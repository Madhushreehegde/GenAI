# GenAI
a multi-modal system that combines text and image generation, showcasing its potential to revolutionize creative and interactive applications

The system utilizes GPT-2, a widely recognized text-generation model, to craft meaning-
ful and context-aware textual responses. These responses are then fed into Stable Diffusion
(runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5), a cutting-edge text-to-image model, to generate visually stun-
ning images based on the text output. By integrating these models using LangChain, the project
demonstrates a streamlined and modular workflow, offering ease of scalability and customization.
GPU acceleration further enhances performance, ensuring quick and high-quality outputs
